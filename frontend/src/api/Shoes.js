        Description:
          "The Air Jordan 1 High ‘85 “Georgetown” is a colorway of Michael Jordan’s first signature shoe that shows appreciation to the Georgetown Hoyas, the college basketball team Jordan famously defeated to earn his first NCAA Championship in 1982. The Jordan 1 High ‘85 “Georgetown” is a near one-to-one remake of the original Air Jordan 1 High from 1985, as it features an accurate-to-original collar height and shape and panel placement, and upgraded materials. Specifically, the “Georgetown” colorway appears in the same color block as the Hoyas’ team uniforms, with Tech Grey leather on the perforated toe, mid-panel, and collar, and contrasting College Navy leather on the overlays and Swoosh branding. A Summit White “Wings” logo appears on the collar and classic “Nike Air” detailing is found on the tongue tag. It all rests on a white midsole and navy blue outsole. The Air Jordan 1 High ‘85 “Georgetown” joins the “Neutral Grey,” “Varsity Red,” and “New Beginnings” colorways in the Jordan 1 High ‘85 collection that honors the legacy of the vintage basketball shoe with retro-inspired design elements.

          "The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low “Reverse Mocha” is a collaboration between the hip-hop artist and Jordan Brand on the low-top lifestyle shoe that “reverses” the color block of the duo’s original Jordan 1 Low collaboration from 2019. Released in July 2022, the “Reverse Mocha” features the same color block as Travis and Jordan Brand’s “Mocha” or “Cactus Jack” Jordan 1 Low, albeit in a flipped color coordination. The perforated toe, mid-panel, and collar are designed in mocha (brown) nubuck. White leather overlays on the toe cap, forefoot, eyelets, and heel contrast the upper’s earth tone base. A backwards cream-colored leather Swoosh, a signature branding element to many of Travis’s sneaker projects, appears on the sides. A smiley face logo is embroidered in red on the left heel while a classic “Wings” logo is embroidered in red on the right heel. Release date: July 21, 2022",

The “Infrared” version of Jordan’s fourth signature shoe also mimics the color block of the Air Jordan 4’s “Green Glow” colorway from 2013, trading the latter’s green accents for Infrared. The shoe features a synthetic nubuck upper in light and dark grey. Black accenting can be found on the black netting found on the tongue and mid-panel, on the “wings,” and inner lining. Lighter shades of grey appear on the toe and outsole. A white Jumpman is located on the black heel counter and an Infrared Jumpman is printed on the black nylon tongue tag on the tongue. Additional Infrared detailing is found on the eyelets. Underfoot, a small visible Air bubble in the white midsole completes the look. Release date: February 8, 2022",

This May 2022 release of the Jordan 5 “Green Bean” colorway is nearly identical to the original version of the sneaker. The shoe’s grey synthetic upper is treated with a reflective finish that is supposedly inspired by the original sketch of the Jordan 5 by Tinker Hatfield. According to rumors, Hatfield sought to design the Air Jordan 5 with a fully reflective upper, but ultimately scrapped the idea prior to the shoe’s production in 1990. As for the rest of the modern “Green Bean’s” design, bright neon green accents appear on the interior lining, on the sharktooth detailing on the midsole, and on the embroidered Jumpman on the silver reflective tongue and on the heel. The shoe features translucent mesh on the sides and on the lower tongue. Release date: May 28, 2022.",

Interestingly, the “Midnight Navy” colorway of the vintage basketball shoe is styled similarly to the model’s “White Infrared,” “Sport Blue,” and original “Maroon” looks. The entire upper, including the perforated panels on the sides, the perforated collar, and overlays, appear in white tumbled leather. A Midnight Navy Jumpman is embroidered onto the white nylon lace overlay.

          "The Air Jordan 1 High OG “Heritage” is a Spring 2022 release of the vintage basketball shoe that shows appreciation for the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan’s former basketball team in the NBA. The “Heritage” is yet another stellar white, red, and black colorway of Jordan’s first signature shoe, and one that also looks to the same 1985 Jordan 1 Sample shoe that inspired the Travis Scott x Fragment x Air Jordan 1 from 2021 as it features the same color block, albeit in different colors, as that popular three-way collaboration. University Red leather appears on the perforated toe, collar, heel, and Swoosh branding. Contrasting white leather can be found on the overlays on the forefoot and eyelets and on the mid-panel, as well. A black “Wings” logo is located on the collar and red “Nike Air” and Swoosh branding dots the black tag on the white nylon tongue. Underfoot, a white midsole and University Red rubber outsole complete the look. Release date: May 25th, 2022.",

          "The Air Jordan 1 “University Blue” was, with certainty, one of the most sought after releases of 2021 thus far. But come later this Spring, the colorway might be outdone as the brand is soon to offer the similarly hyped “Hyper Royal.” And though it’s been seen time and time again in its adult size, we’ve yet to show off the pair’s GS run. Like the aforementioned, the “Hyper Royal” will likely arrive in full family sizes, all touting the same details, colors, and materials. Suedes of both solid and patterned tone mark outfit throughout, with the titular blues worked into the overlays — i.e. the toe cap, eye stay, counter, etc. Elsewhere, Swooshes, collars, and treads tinge in grey, adding yet another unique element over top a more plain, leather base.",

The Jordan 1 High ‘85 “Georgetown” is a near one-to-one remake of the original Air Jordan 1 High from 1985, as it features an accurate-to-original collar height and shape and panel placement, and upgraded materials. Specifically, the “Georgetown” colorway appears in the same color block as the Hoyas’ team uniforms, with Tech Grey leather on the perforated toe, mid-panel, and collar, and contrasting College Navy leather on the overlays and Swoosh branding. A Summit White “Wings” logo appears on the collar and classic “Nike Air” detailing is found on the tongue tag. It all rests on a white midsole and navy blue outsole. The Air Jordan 1 High ‘85 “Georgetown” joins the “Neutral Grey,” “Varsity Red,” and “New Beginnings” colorways in the Jordan 1 High ‘85 collection that honors the legacy of the vintage basketball shoe with retro-inspired design elements.

While the shade fits neither Michael Jordan’s threads at UNC or Chicago, it’s been part of the origin story of Air Jordan footwear with the Air Jordan 1 and beyond. Specifically with the Air Jordan 3, the “True Blue” established the hue as one of the most significant in the Jordan annals, which is why new concoctions like the Air Jordan 3 “Racer Blue” just seem to make sense. Arriving at retailers on July 10th, 2021 is the “Racer Blue” Jordan 3s, complete with white tumbled leather uppers, grey accents, and a new style of elephant print on the toe-box and heel that is said to be reflective. Further separating itself from the OGs is the Jumpman logo on the heel (Nike Air is clearly reserved for the originals, special editions, and collaborations).",

The Black/Cement Air Jordan 3 Retro OG comes back in its original form. Featuring black tumbled and smooth leather uppers and all the distinct details we remember thirty years later.",

The Tinker-designed silhouette had already teased a possible return of its “Cool Grey” makeup, as well as a Georgetown-themed colorway, and now its piling on another entry to add to its growing catalog. We still have yet to see a first look at an actual pair, but we do know that this forthcoming rendition will be a pair designed for women. Color-wise, it appears it will feature “Sail” base complexions coupled with that of “Rust Pink” and “Crimson” accents. Peep a look at mock-up here, and note that they will be targeting a drop sometime during Spring 2021",

The upper is constructed from white tumbled leather. The Jordan 3’s iconic elephant patterning found on the toe and heel are designed in a shade of dark brown. A Jumpman logo is paired with “Air” branding on the heel and an Atmosphere—or pink—Jumpman is embroidered on the white leather tongue. Release date: May 14, 2022",

Similar to the PE version, the retail Air Jordan 3 “UNC” features a white tumbled leather base that includes hits on the toe and mid-panel. Contrasting along the mudguard comes in the form of Air Jordan 3-specific elephant print on the toe, lateral panel, and heel that contrasts a solid white leather mudguard. Completing the look is black Jumpman branding on the heel and a light grey outsole.",

Last seen in retailers in 2012, the Air Jordan 4 “Military Blue” added a slew of new collectors to its circle while maintaining its core base from its original ’89 release. Now, what’s going to be 32-year hiatus since featured in its OG skeleton. The classic has now been in rumor talks to arrive fitted in Original Nike Branding like its brothers for what’s currently going on two years but has yet to come to fruition. For 2021, an Off-White version of the shoe is currently in motion as Virgil prepares his take on the ’89 classic. While details are still scarce at the moment, an earlier leaked image of the shoe had surfaced the web featuring similar designs like the Air Jordan 4 WMNS “Sail” released late last year, but that was as far as news outlets pushed the envelop. Moving forward, it leaves us wondering will Jordan Brand scrap Virgil’s Off-White release in favor of the Air Jordan 4 OG Military Blue return, or will we see both takes on the shoe hit retailers later this year.",

          "First teased at the tail-end of June 2021, the Air Jordan 5 “Racer Blue” has finally emerged via official images ahead of its February 12th release date. Reminiscent of the mix one would get when combining the model’s famed “Stealth” and “Oreo” colorways, the upcoming sneakers indulge in a mostly “Black” suede construction. Signature mesh profile windows and reflective tops of tongues deviate from their stealthy surroundings in shades of silver, with the latter components also featuring detailing in the titular “Racer Blue” tone. Jumpman logos on the spine employ a slightly-lighter variant of the aforementioned blue, while midsoles and branding visible through the semi-translucent tread revert to a rich shade reminiscent of “Royal”-colored Air Jordans of yesteryear.",

          "In terms of sneaker releases, 2021 is proving to be more and more eventful by the day. Jordan Brand, with just the first few months alone, is impressing right out of the gate as they’re to launch not only brand new colorways but also long-awaited retros like the Neutral Grey Jordan 1 85, Air Jordan 6 Carmine, and (as leaked today) the Air Jordan 5 Oreo. Scheduled for later this coming Summer, the colorway will likely mirror the success of its drop back in 2013. Ranked as one of the best-selling Jordans that year, the pair went on to move over 500,000 units due likely in part to its versatile scheme. Black suedes wrap much of the upper in a near vantablack-like saturation, while the sole leans into its “Oreo” nickname by way of bright trims and spiked prints of black with white speckling. The outsole underfoot then contrasts in an icy blue, the lace toggle outfits the instep in a see-through finish, and both the Jumpman symbols and side netting color in a light grey.",

The “Concord” theme was introduced on the Jordan 11 back in 1996, and is one of the most popular colorways in sneaker history. Here, on the Jordan 5, the “Concord” features the same color block as the model’s classic “Fire Red” colorway, albeit with purple accents instead of red detailing per the original version. The upper is constructed from white leather. Translucent mesh is found on the mid-panel and lower tongue. A purple or Concord-colored Jumpman is embroidered on the heel. Additional Concord accenting can be found on the Jumpman on the reflective Metallic Silver tongue, on the collar, on the underside of the tongue, and on the shark tooth detailing on the black painted midsole.

This May 2022 release of the Jordan 5 “Green Bean” colorway is nearly identical to the original version of the sneaker. The shoe’s grey synthetic upper is treated with a reflective finish that is supposedly inspired by the original sketch of the Jordan 5 by Tinker Hatfield. According to rumors, Hatfield sought to design the Air Jordan 5 with a fully reflective upper, but ultimately scrapped the idea prior to the shoe’s production in 1990. As for the rest of the modern “Green Bean’s” design, bright neon green accents appear on the interior lining, on the sharktooth detailing on the midsole, and on the embroidered Jumpman on the silver reflective tongue and on the heel. The shoe features translucent mesh on the sides and on the lower tongue. Release date: May 28, 2022.",

The “Midnight Navy” was once part of Jordan Brand’s “Retro+” collection, a series of non-original colorways from the late ‘90s and early 2000s that put a new “lifestyle” spin on classic Air Jordan models, like the Air Jordan 6. Interestingly, the “Midnight Navy” colorway of the vintage basketball shoe is styled similarly to the model’s “White Infrared,” “Sport Blue,” and original “Maroon” looks. The entire upper, including the perforated panels on the sides, the perforated collar, and overlays, appear in white tumbled leather. A Midnight Navy Jumpman is embroidered onto the white nylon lace overlay. Additional Midnight Navy accenting comes into play on the lace toggle with white Jumpman branding, on the tongue, and on the spoiler on the heel. A navy blue Jumpman is stitched onto the heel above white “Air” branding. Release date: March 2022",

A medium wash blue denim material covers the entire upper and is contrasted by a light wash denim base on the mid-panel and toe. Jordan Brand opts for a black nylon tongue that features a “natural” leather lace cover that mirrors a patch that you would find on the back of a pair of jeans. A black mudguard and cream-colored midsole with visible Air in the heel completes the look.",

White leather overlays contrast the light grey perforated synthetic nubuck base that appears on the mid-panel and toe. A red neoprene lace cover with a black Jumpman logo sits just below the clear rubber tongue that reveals the multicolor geometric pattern found on the Jordan 7’s tongue underneath.

However, for those who are still hungry for the OG “Columbia” colorway, it will return as one of the annual Air Jordan 11 Low drops for Summer 2021. Of course the original Columbias have been renamed the “Legend Blue” Jordan 11 after its release in December 2014, but the colorway is exactly what you’d expect – a full white upper with black interiors and a strip of that UNC blue on the Jumpman Jordan tongue ribbon as well as the exposed carbon fiber plate at the mid-footed. Blue-tinted icy soles only make this release that much more attractive. One key detail that should not be ignored is that the insole, in that familiar numbering style, reads “25” instead of 23″. This could possibly point a 25th Anniversary of the debut of the Air Jordan 11 “Columbia” which occurred during the 1996 All-Star Game. 1995 is recognized as the year the model itself debuted.",

And to help spearhead its return, the silhouette is reviving its “Bright Citrus” colorway, offering it in adult sizing for the very first time. First released as a GS exclusive back in 2015, the scheme is a rather understated mix of white and its titular color. The latter only stands out by way of the slightly translucent sole and the instep’s branding, while the former dresses more widespread. This neutral can be found throughout the leather base, laces, eyelets, tongue, and even the patent midsole that nods to OGs. What’s more, there’s an additional detail that sets its apart from the original: an OG carbon fiber plate, a first for the women’s version of the model.",

Its two-tone, white and violet color block replicates the two-color design of the Jordan 11 Low’s collection of initial releases from 2001. The upper is constructed with a white ballistic mesh material. A Pure Violet patent leather mudguard contrasts the neutral appearance of the shoe’s upper. White rope laces are incorporated into the quick-lace design setup. The white foam midsole houses a full-length Air cushioning unit. Underfoot, the semi-translucent outsole is fortified by a carbon fiber shank plate. Release date: April 28",

          "The Air Jordan 13 hasn’t celebrated a milestone anniversary throughout 2020 as some of its counterparts have, but it’s remained in headlines thanks to ESPN’s “The Last Dance” docu-series, the Jordan Women’s Reign and a handful of solid colorways. For 2021, the panther-inspired model is rumored to launch in a “Black/Court Purple/White” makeup sure to instantly sell out. An early mock-up of the pair suggests that the release will follow that of an inaugural option, as the upper is split between the two darkest aforementioned hues. Unlike the Jordan 13 “Bred,” however, the forthcoming retro is depicted with a dimpled leather vamp-to-heel overlay instead of a mesh variant. A holographic eye remains at the lateral heel, while the upper’s suede component indulges in “Court Purple” (which has had a stellar 2020); part of the midsole also partakes in the rich color, while the panther paw-reminiscent outsole grooves revert back to a “Black” makeup. In a move that’s somewhat of an eyebrow-raiser, the outsoles have been dipped in a contrasting “White” arrangement, which may lead some consumers to pick up a Sharpie marker or spray paint can .",

Recently surfaced retailer images only build up hype for the eventual debut, all while giving us a more detailed look at the simple yet clean colorway. Prepared in full family sizes and accompanied by OG packaging, the Air Jordan 13 “Del Sol” helps usher in Spring with a touch of bright yellow. The warm tone blossoms across the lower profile before wrapping the brunt of the heel. A bright green, then, pops over top courtesy of the holographic emblem, while the dimpled construction adjacent opts for a neutral white leather assembly. The Jumpman branding along the tongue and insole isn’t quite as a bereft of color, as both instances feature a bold, Bulls-reminiscent red.",

This colorful take features a bright Aurora Green felt base with white leather paneling and pink, green, and blue stitching accents. An embroidered blue Jumpman covers the tongue while a pink Jordan Brand tab appears where the tongue connects to the toe. This Air Jordan 13 for kids swaps out the holographic “panther’s eye” emblem on the collar for an embroidered Jumpman logo with “23” branding. Colorful rope laces complete the fun design. The Air Jordan 13 GS “Aurora Green” was released on May 9, 2020.",
